Excercise move the block

The Mission
Have a square that you can move using the arrow keys. Have another square representing food. When the player touches the food it goes to a different location.

By Cheung Kin Wong

Things still left to do:

[] make the shuttle unable to leave the box
[] make the collision hit on hitbox rather the center
[] add background
[] make sure the planet spawns inside the box
