Excercise move the block

The Mission
Have a square that you can move using the arrow keys. Have another square representing food. When the player touches the food it goes to a different location.

By Cheung Kin Wong

Things still left to do:

[x] make the shuttle unable to leave the box
[x] make the collision hit on hitbox rather the center
[x] add background
[x] make sure the planet spawns inside the box
